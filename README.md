# WildTag

Originally made for _Spigot 1.16_, then rewritten for _Paper 1.20.6_, and now slightly tweaked for _Paper/Folia 1.21.6+_!  
Remake of a minigame, requested by a friend ;)

Ever thought of playing tag in Minecraft using your world? Well this is the plugin for you!  

> [!CAUTION]
> Use on a copy of your world or a new one, as the plugin **will** modify inventories & spawn locations.

The main command is `/wildtag` and requires the `wildtag.cmd` permission.
